Platformer Starter Template Chapter 3

For those who want to start creating platform games,
but having too much trouble to start.

Special thanks to "mutantleg", who made biomekanoidChicken.
I studied the code from that game, and I now add comments to the code
to make it easier to read and understand.

Chapter 3 : Levels and Enemies
Before studying this chapter, I suggest you go through the first and/or
second chapter first, because this chapter is complicated and long.
In this chapter, first focus on how enemy works, and then how the player
will interact with the enemy. Next stuff to study is the life system, and the
last one is the level system. The life and level systems can be studied in
PlatformerWorld Class. These are my orders of studying this chapter's
code. You can start anywhere you want that fits you the most.
You can do it better if you try it with your own sprites.
If you can understand all these, you are more likely to be able
to start your own platform game from now on!

That's all I can explain for you, you can study the code more by yourself.
